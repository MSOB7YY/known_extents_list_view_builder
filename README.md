# known_extents_list_view_builder

This package is intended to address [this issue in Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/52207).

This is not official Flutter package. Maintainance and edges cases are not guaranteed.

To see the difference it makes when using a scroll bar to move through a long, variable extent list you can run `example/lib/reorderable_list_view_side_by_side.dart` or watch this video taken in release mode (add video link).
